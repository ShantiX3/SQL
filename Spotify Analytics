# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle
# Then, I created a table to download Spotify data into
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL


CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,

FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms ASC

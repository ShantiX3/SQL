For this project, I work with a dataset called chinook - which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.
Below are some interesting questions I have answered for this database.


##1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.



SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country

FROM chinook.customers

WHERE Country <> "USA";





##2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.



SELECT *

FROM chinook.customers

WHERE Country = "Brazil";



##3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.

The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.



SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.billingcountry, i.invoiceid, i.invoiceDate

FROM chinook.customers c

LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices i

ON i.customerid = c.customerid

WHERE country = "Brazil";







##4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.



SELECT * FROM chinook.employees

WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";







##5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.



SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry

FROM chinook.invoices;





##6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.

The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.invoiceId

FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust

ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.invoices inv

ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;




##7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country,

and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.



SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, Inv.total

FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust

ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv

ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;






##8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?



SELECT COUNT(*)

FROM chinook.invoices

WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';







##9. What are the total sales for 2009?



SELECT SUM(Total)

FROM Chinook.invoices

WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';









##10. Write a query that includes

the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.



SELECT trac.Name, items.invoicelineid

FROM chinook.tracks trac

JOIN chinook.invoice_items items

ON trac.Trackid = items.Trackid;







##11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name

AND artist name with each invoice line ID.



SELECT it.InvoiceLineId, t.Name AS Track, ar.name AS Artist

FROM chinook.Invoice_items it

LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t

ON it.TrackID = t.TrackID

INNER JOIN chinook.albums a

ON a.AlbumID = t.AlbumID

LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar

ON ar.ArtistID= a.ArtistID;





##12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks,

and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.



SELECT T.Name AS Track, A.Title AS Album, MT.Name AS Media_Type, G.Name AS Genre

FROM chinook.tracks T

JOIN chinook.albums A

ON T.Trackid = A.Albumid

JOIN chinook.media_types MT

ON MT.MediaTypeid = T.MediaTypeid

JOIN chinook.genres G

ON T.Genreid = G.Genreid







##13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.




SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName,

ROUND (SUM(I.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'

FROM chinook.employees E

JOIN chinook.customers C

ON E.Employeeid = C.SupportRepid

JOIN chinook.invoices I

ON I.Customerid = C.Customerid

WHERE E.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'

GROUP BY E.FirstName;





##14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?



SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName,

ROUND (SUM(I.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'

FROM chinook.Employees E

JOIN chinook.Customers C

ON C.SupportRepid = E.Employeeid

JOIN chinook.invoices I

ON I.Customerid = C.Customerid

WHERE E.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'

AND I.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'

GROUP BY E.FirstName

ORDER BY (round(sum(I.Total), 2)) DESC LIMIT 1;
